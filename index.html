                        <h2>The Balancing Act</h2>
                        <p>Body sway is a natural phenomenon as we stand. Even when we think we're perfectly still, our body makes tiny adjustments to maintain balance.</p>
                        <p>This constant adjustment becomes more pronounced as we age, increasing the risk of falls in older populations.</p>

                        <p>Scientists measure sway in two primary directions:</p>
                        <p><strong>Anterior-Posterior (AP):</strong> Forward and backward movement</p>
                        <p><strong>Medial-Lateral (ML):</strong> Side-to-side movement</p>

                <h2>Write-Up (Prototype)</h2>
                <p>Following completing the original checkpoint, the Dream Team realized that their data was not sufficient for a final project. The dataset was simply too small, and we felt like it would be difficult to find conclusions in the data that we could talk about in a “scrolly-telling” manner that wouldn’t be too simplistic. As a result, we went back to the drawing board, and eventually stumbled upon the body sway dataset. This dataset shows body movement for 28 subjects over the course of a minute in different situations, where the variables lie in the “loudness” of the Mozart music being played, as well as whether the subject had its eyes closed or not. So far, we’ve added a basic description of the experiment to contextualize it for viewers. We wrote code for a rough template of the style we want our website to be in both JS and CSS . We constructed a human body using a couple of shapes for our first visualization, and added a hover element on it to help understand what the natural amount of body sway in humans would be. We did some data cleaning by grouping data in milliseconds to data in seconds, preparing to add a section in our website that talks about summary statistics. Next, our plan is to continue to do more exploratory data analysis to further determine what additional visualizations to add, and the organization of what we want to display to the viewers. There will be many challenging aspects of our design. One obstacle that we assume we will face is dealing with the large amount of data. The data we were given comes in a total of 336 CSV files, so conducting EDA on that much data will be difficult. It will take a lot of perseverance and teamwork to derive conclusions from data much larger than anything any of the four of us have ever worked with. In addition, another challenging part of our design will be determining the most effective visual encodings to use when constructing our webpage. With many different options of what to use, balancing the variety and simplicity of our visualizations will be key in keeping the viewers engaged and interested in our final product.</p>
