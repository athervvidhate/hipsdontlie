                <p>This study examined how music and virtual reality affects body sway, which is the natural movement of the body while standing. 
                    28 participants stood on a balance platform that measured their Center Of Pressure (COP) movement in the x and y directions, indicating how much the body moved. 
                </p>
        
                <p> They experienced different combinations of visual conditions (eyes closed, looking at VR) and music conditions (listening to Mozart's Jupiter Symphony). 
                </p>
        
                <p>Researchers hypothesized that music and VR motion would increase body sway, potentially providing insights into new balance training methods for older adults and individuals at risk of falls.
